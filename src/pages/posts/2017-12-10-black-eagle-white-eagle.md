One black Eagle chases a black and white eagle with a fish in its talons across the lake as the boatman rows me across the placid water bubbling with life at the foot of the mountain. There are 45 minutes of steps which go sheer up into the jungle to the Peace Pagoda. Glowing green blue, worn smooth in places by centuries of feet. Sometimes with tree roots growing under and between. A space in the jungle cleared and a carpet of leaves and branches and I'm following an old man with bundles of wood on his back his timeless gaze wanders over me as we pass.
