Outside the African Trading Post in Cape Town harbour by the waterfront, two seals gliding by while cormorants dive and seagulls cry. A huge rolling wave of cloud envelops Table Mountain, rock disappearing under a white blanket as it moves towards the city and then before the skyscrapers vanishes as the winds blow it east and all chance of rain vanishes. Tomorrow will embark on a roadtrip following the winds along the coast and the Wild Route.
