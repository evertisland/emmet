Outside the African Trading Post in Cape Town harbour by the waterfront, two seals gliding by while cormorants dive and seagulls cry. A huge rolling wave of cloud envelops Table Mountain, rock disappearing under a white blanket as it moves towards the city and then before the skyscrapers vanishes as the winds blow it east and all chance of rain vanishes. Tomorrow a pirate, a poet and a hippy will embark on a roadtrip following the winds along the coast and the Wild Route. To get of taste of Africa, and to add our own flavour to this wonderful continent of people, nature and landscapes
