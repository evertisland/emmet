Hands down, Pacifico on the north-east coast of Siargao Island is my favourite place in the world right now. A 3km stretch of sand, perched on the edge of the ocean, a landscape barely poking out of the sea which expands like a gigantic green, blue, aquamarine soup bowl into the horizon, throwing frothy fists of water, shifting white lines, slurping hungrily up the sides of the golden sands. Stand on the beach in the morning at 5.30am and watch the dawn erupt. The sky catches fire, vast clouds reflecting orange reds, pinks, and black, time is eternal waiting for the sun, colours wash the night away. God’s thumb print is suspended in the air as the brilliant yellow of the sun peeks blindingly above the horizon, burning everything a brilliant white, as it slowly climbs a pathway is projected onto the sea like the sweep of an enormous clock hand beginning its circuit for the day.

Bathed in light, the air heats up, feel a tickle by your toes and look down to see a small hermit crab trundling over your feet on its way to the water. On careful inspection of the beach you realise its entirely made of these tiny creatures, trillions of shells, ground down into finer and finer pieces over millions of years. I give up counting the 8 different kinds of blue moving in 5 different directions, the surging currents greet a river coming from the jungle, huge breakers, several stories high break in the distance on the point, the mist magically drifts across the jungle canopy.

Hope For the Island

I’m staying at Pacifico Beach Resort positioned at the south end of the beach, visible for an instant through the jungle canopy as you roll down the hill. Pacifico Beach Resort is just three building which blend into the environment. A green beach hut that sleeps 4, the beach house with 4 double rooms and a bunkbed area and the Garden house with 3 more rooms one family room large enough to accommodate eight people. The rooms are clean, comfortable and well serviced. For 20 euro a night, halve that if you are sharing, it is exceptional value, an ocean breeze gently rattling the mosquito mesh on your open window as you fall asleep to the sound of the surf and wake up to a million dollar view. The resort is a paragon of the sustainable tourism we hear so much about, the restaurant serves food made from organic ingredients sourced on the Hope For the Island Farm some 10km away.

The staff are local, well trained, friendly, and extremely accommodating. Experiencing a black out on the island, all guests were provided with emergency lights and the kitchen, cooking on gas, remained open. The calamari is one of the best I ever tasted, the banana-cacao shake is legendary. Everything on the menu is worth a try. And even when the chef is away, the staff are all skilled up to be able to cook at the same high level. Hire a bicycle, surfboard, or splash out on some locally made jewelry, or surf wear in case you forget your board shorts, as I did. This is the perfect environment for meditation and yoga, quietly sitting and observing the ocean, or walking along the soft slanting sand. Surf one of the best waves on the island, and also one of the most frustrating, the currents mean that it is not for beginners, but when it works it really works.

Red Sky in the Morning

So why do I want to share this? Siargao is experiencing the first winds of a tourism Tsunami. One year ago there was one plane a day bringing mostly surfers who came based on the word of mouth about the pristine nature, uncrowded breaks, and laid back island vibe. 6 flights are now landing daily at the tiny domestic airport and an international airport is scheduled to be opened in the next few years. There is a new dawn on Siargao, property prices have increased threefold in a year, huge swathes of land snapped up by overseas investors. I contend that small locally run and sourced resorts are the best hope for the island retaining its authenticity. The ethos at Pacifico Beach Resort with the emphasis on recycling, non-PET policy, organic locally produced fresh food, and local workers is a ray of hope, sustainable and bringing jobs and skills development.

As more resorts open their doors, and Siargao increasing becomes the domestic getaway of choice, importing customer service trained workers from off the island oft becomes the norm. Yet take a cruise up north and visit Pacifico, see the real island life and conditions, support the local fledgling ventures. Pacifico Beach Resort is a hub connecting you to a wheel of initiatives, you can do yoga and find info about the SEA (Siargao Environment Awareness Movement) Movement and their beach cleanups. Surf and then meet Grom Nation collecting old surfboards, teaching the local kids to surf for free for their participation in education and skills programmes. Meditate and give a donation to the Nature Kids of Siargao who are raising money for a shredder to upcycle plastics and contribute. So visit Pacifico on Sairgao, connect and contribute to these initiatives and help keep paradise on the Pacific pristine for the locals and future visitors.
