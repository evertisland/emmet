A completely bonkers day. Up at 7am in Pakhora to catch Buddha Air to Kathmandu at 9.20am, only a 25 minute flight along the mountain ranges in transit for a 2.45pm to Kuala Lumpah and an overnight, then onto Cebu, Philippines, in the morning. The first flight is delayed, go drinking coffee and smoking fags with Luke from California on the airport veranda. Saw an eagle circle, swoop and scoop a snake, wriggling in its talons, as the bird flapped off, twisting with the mountains in the background 'til it was dropped. Meet some young police is colourful army fatigues, the whole country is in a state of high alert, the elections are in full swing and a splinter group of Maoist guerrillas are doing their best to disrupt them. Get a cool picture of the cops and Luke, we smile and joke with them, their speech, faces shining and glad to practice some English. Going back into the terminal the steward says its another 30 minutes. 



Nepali chaos starts to unfold now, the fog in Kathmandu has snarled everything up. Some two hours later and no plane, every flight is delayed, every engine I peer expectently but it's Yeti Air, or Nepali Air, no Buddha Air. Take some McVites chocolate digestives and read the Perfumed Garden in the airport shop to stay calm - it helps somewhat.

When the plane eventually arrives it is already gone midday, have checked in on-line by now for KL but my phone battery is painfully low. Luke has his ticket for the local flight with both of our checked in baggage receipts stapled to it (more on this later) and we climb onto a twin prop, bumping along the runway to buzz the hilltops with the Himalayas poking through the haze and clouds to the left. Two fantastic Brazilian looking stewardesses hand out boiled sweets before they strap themselves into the front and rear of the plane, which looks like it was made in the 50s. When they unbuckle and hand out water the combination of their contoured red and blue uniforms, flawless makeup and great smell takes my mind off the ticking clock, joking with them they assure us of their Nepali origin. We land at 1pm, and seem to taxi forever, then a bus pulls us outside the window, am out the door in a flash, from my bus seat I see an elderly woman in a sari coming painfully down the steps of of the plane, am really starting to control my breathing and stay calm. The bus fills up with old Japanese ladies and I give up my seat, grasping the yellow handrail a little too tightly.

The bus shudders to a halt at the domestic terminal. I cam see the international one some half a kilometre away. Inside it is chaos, all the delayed flights have arrived at the same time, there is no customs so hundreds of relatives, friends, hawkers, you name it add to the hordes as slowly bags are unloaded, there are four trolleys standing in a row untouched, two guys checking baggage receipts and heaving over luggage. Luke has vanished, I check outside to see if he is smoking but he is gone. My flight is now an hour from taking off, am really pumped and I can't even get near the roller where the bags are slowly being handed over. So I step out to where the trolleys are standing nervously making a ciggie and scam them for my bag, spot it and begin tugging it out from under the others. A man starts to shout at me, 'hey that's not allowed' I pull my bag free, snapping back at him, 'I'm gonna miss my flight', I can still hear him shouting as I sprint out of the airport into the carpark, any moment expecting to hear a police whistle.

The phone is buzzing in my pocket, it's Luke, am striding towards the international terminal putting distance between any interference, 'can't talk' I gasp, he's staying on In Kathmandu and right now every interaction counts, arriving at the departure gate to show my e-ticket the phone empties. I run to the Air Asia check which is mercilessly, or worrying empty, and slap down my passport. The girl is non phased checking my details and handing me my boarding card and I'm up the escalator to another security screening. Then it's immigration, you have to fill a form and queue for a beady eyed official to slowly look me up and down and stamp my passport, the visa expiring exactly today. He knocks on the counter as I'm about to leave, summoning the next foreigner clutching his form, and bound around the corner looking for directions and right into another queue for an even more stringent bag screening. Belt off, pockets emptied I don't beep and through to another checkpoint and a guard who checks my boarding pass. 'No, you don't have a stamp, go back' he says.

Plugging in my phone in the seat with extra leg room at the front of the rear section. Again a Nosey Nepalese is looking at my messages while I write, I already told him once, he shyly looks away. I was the last person to board, sweaty, flooded with adrenalin, massively relieved. It's the weirdest flight ever, fully loaded with 90% Nepalese, barely a word of English and a crew where none of them speak Nepalese. The Nepalese late-teens in new trainers gape out of windows on take off and past the Himalayas but are even more wide eyed and attentive when the stewardesses demonstrate the safety programme. A Filipino stewardess scolds one of the yokals for not flushing when he comes out of the toilet. They all look like they drew the short straw plane today. When I ask her has ever been to Nepal she answers no, I can imagine her face when confronted with a downtown Kathmandu loo. They passengers are up down all time before the plane takes off, and then when we are in the air are wandering round again. As fascinated in me as I in them we are eyeing each other cautiously. It seems strange to fly just before the elections. Now they eat bread and roam about the cabin, chatting and back slapping vigorously. Where can they be going? Construction? It seems they are cheap labour in the rich Malaysia, and sure enough they all receive the same inflight meal which is pre-booked and pre-paid. Yet again Asia is truly amazing, the layers or so intense, complicated, ancient as fascinating. Nepal, the rooftop of the world is being suffocated by garbage in places, where in others a radiant and passive timelessness overpowers with its raw beauty and simplicity. I can't wait to come back.
