the trucks they park in gangs

colourful monsters with Krishna on the bonnet 

and names like adidas and nike painted on the side

their split screens look like eyes

tyres thick and knobbly.

Dusty covered wagons in blues and greens and red

bringing in goods from India

streamers dragging on the road

 vast diesel engines growling

 with little brown men inside
