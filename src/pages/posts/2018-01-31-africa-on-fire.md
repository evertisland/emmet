Africa on Fire from Mussel Bay to Knysna to Jeffreys Bay

The black tarmac winds through the treelined hills, the coast tantalisingly out of view. Dark mountain peaks are on three sides, looming giants puncturing gray clouds, timeless ranges framing a scorched landscape, huge fires have been raging and the terrain is dotted with blackened sticks that were young trees. Zipping through Bonniedale at the foot of the nearest mountain, we have a quarter of a tank and are on the hunt for a petrol station. As we rise we calculate about an hours worth of driving, the pine forests stretch out beneath us and smoky plumes dot the horizon as our ears pop with the altitude. A jagged ravine plunge below us, like blackened teeth in an oily throat disappearing into an abyss. The burned mountainside and the smell of the toasted inclines up to the still smoking peaks, it looks like a range of volcanoes up on Robinson's Pass. Coming down and a hillside is on flames, the fire sounds like the ocean, a flickering orange crown on a browned scalp. And then the road flattens out, small bushes, Mount Hope on our left, we are in leopard country. Crossing dried up riverbeds, rusting caravans and small farmsteads cling to the sandy rocky terrain, ostrich farms. Huge steel irrigation machines on wheels cultivate patches of green in an otherwise barren valley punctuated by the smokey stacks which tinge the air with a hazy gray film. An Ostrich savanna appears, they are everywhere, their white arses in the air, or bathing in the reddish sand, black wings raising clouds of dust.

Waboomskrall, acres of netted fields, interspersed with vineyards, the roadside vegetation replacing the red boulders, stuck behind a truck from a copper mine, blind corners a light rain. An up up again into the mountain a on way to George. Vast green slopes in the clouds, fat fingers of rock stretching down hundreds of metres.

Standing taking in the views and a bank of mist rises and suddenly we are in a cloud and everything vanishes, and its raining. Jumping back in the car and down down down we go, four passes in only a few kilometres, scenery upon scenery, layered beauty, raw nature made accessible by road makers determined to open up the southern most tip of Africa.

A town called George, and we are now going along the coast, gigantic breakers rolling onto white sand, spray bursting high into the air, a white mist where kiteboaders skim the surf. Stylish beachfront properties, colourful copses, vast sparkling lagoons, it's another paradise.

Leaving Knysner, an upmarket, yachty hideaway after pizza at the waterfront, and the forest out of town are more black trunks with green tops from the fires, or cleared fields with charcoal stumps where the flames raged hardest. You can see how wind blew the fires creating a furnace channel taking out some trees while leaving others untouched. All the time on the radio are traffic updates, the N2 is unpassable due to the fires. After half an hour we are on the Garden Route, the traffic disspears, we whizz along a green tunnel. Passing by Storms River Village and the rain comes, cooling more burning mountains. The road is straight forever and the night comes on all purply blue as we head towards red dots in the sky from a gigantic windfarm. Onwards to Jeffrey's Bay. After almost an hour there is the first curve in the road, this is a big country. Pulling into town bumping along pot-holed roads through a shanty town on our way to the beach and the hostel Chilled Vibes.

Waking up in Jeffrey's Bay to the sound of the surf, the first real sun in a couple of days, the wind has dropped and it seems like summer has arrived.

And the radio played:
